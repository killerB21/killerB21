 sick and tired of feeling like i'm
living in a ghost town
come and come around
it's getting harder and harder to beat
six feet
somebody come
[Applause]
sick and tired of feeling like i'm
living in a ghost town
oh
somebody call me
like
oh
sick and tired
you</pre>

 Daylight is fading away
Night silhouettesin the sky
LED lights are flashing on towers
It's Manhattanâ€™s magical time
Ballerinas dancing the "Swan Lake"
On a river made of diamonds and pearls
Everything's a little bit weird now



[Pre-Chorus]
Because tonight it is showtime
All we celebrate are good times 
Because tonight it is showtime 
Come and walk with me! </pre>

	All day and all night
We'd stay up it felt so right
We were so young
We were so dumb
We would get drunk
And then hook up
We were ok
We were alright
Stayin awake
Till the sun rise
We were in love
Couldn't stop us like a good drug
Never enough
We'd hook up in my car
Drive it so far
Play you guitar
You'd show me ur art

 You'll never take us alive
We swore that death will do us part
They'll call our crimes a work of art
You'll never take us alive
We'll live like spoiled royalty
Lovers and partners
Partners in crime

Partners in crime
This a tale of reckless love
Living a life of crime on the run
A brush to a gun
To paint these states green and red

 If you're gonna treat me right
I'll take you to heaven every night
But God forbid you leave me by myself
I'll take you to hell, take you to hell

Three golden rings he got on his hand
He likes to go to the south of France
I can't tell if this is romance
Baby, what's his plans?

I don't wanna be a diva, so dramatic
But that's the price you're paying
 if you want my magic
Not the kind of lover you can just
 get back with, no, no</pre>
